**How would you reverse the elements in a stack (i.e., put the elements at the top of the stack on the bottom and vice versa)? You can use as many additional stacks and queues as temporary storage in your approach.**

What we're doing is starting with a stack ADT that holds some data. Using the stack's .pop() operation, we remove each element from the top of the stack one by one. As we do this, we insert each element into a queue ADT using its .enqueue() operation. Although enqueue is not part of the stack interface, it belongs to the queue and allows us to build up the elements in the order they were popped. At this point, the top element of the original stack is now at the front of the queue, and the bottom element is at the back. Next, we begin dequeuing from the queue and immediately pushing each item back onto the stack. Because queues follow FIFO (first in, first out) and stacks follow LIFO (last in, first out), this sequence of operations results in the stack being filled in the exact reverse order it started with.
