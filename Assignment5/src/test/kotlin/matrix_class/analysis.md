In theory, Strassen’s algorithm should be faster because it reduces the number of multiplications compared to normal matrix multiplication, but in practice it doesn’t always work out that way. On a real computer, Strassen has a lot of extra overhead, it keeps splitting matrices into smaller pieces, making lots of recursive calls, creating new temporary matrices, and doing many additions and subtractions. All of that makes it slower for small and medium matrix sizes, since the computer spends more time managing memory and function calls than actually multiplying numbers. A better approach is to use a hybrid method, where the program switches back to regular matrix multiplication once the matrices get small enough (like 64×64 or 128×128). That way, you avoid the overhead of recursion for small cases but still get Strassen’s speed advantage for larger ones. I personally used the 64x64 as the baseline to when my program switches back to normal matrix multiplication and it definitely did speed up results by decreasing the load on the recursive call stack.
