### Lempel–Ziv Compression Results

I tested my Lempel–Ziv (LZ78) compression on six strings made up only of A’s and B’s, and the results were really interesting. When I used short strings like “ABABABA” or “AAAAAA,” the algorithm already found some repeating patterns and made them smaller. For longer inputs, the difference was even bigger. For example, “ABABABABABABABAB” and “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” got reduced the most because they had lots of repetition for the dictionary to reuse. The “AABBAABB” patterns didn’t compress as well since the repeating blocks were shorter, but the longer version “AABBAABBAABBAABBAABB” did a bit better. Overall, I noticed that the more repeated or predictable the pattern is, the better the compression ratio. Lempel–Ziv works really well when the data has structure, but not as much when things are more random. This version of Lempel–Ziv is more of a conceptual compression...meaning it reorganizes the data using repeated patterns, but doesn’t actually reduce the number of bytes in memory yet. A full compression would take this output and bit-pack it into a smaller binary format. So while it looks shorter in terms of elements, each pair still takes up space, and real compression would need one more step.
